# Corp Manage

## Project Overview
Corp Manage is a Django application designed to streamline administrative tasks for company management. It provides tools for managing resources and enhancing productivity within corporate environments. This project leverages Django's robust framework to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Installation

To set up Corp Manage on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/corp-manage.git
   cd corp-manage
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   Make sure you have Django installed. If there's a `requirements.txt` or similar file in your project, use:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you do not have a requirements file, you can install Django with:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```
